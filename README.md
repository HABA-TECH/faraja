# Faraja:  
 
 
## Setup

To get started with Faraja, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Flutter SDK installed on your machine. You can find detailed installation instructions in the Flutter documentation: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

### Clone the Repository

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
2. Run the following command to clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/HABA-TECH/faraja`


### Project Structure

The faraja Flutter project follows the following structure:

- **assets**: Contains any static assets required by the app, such as images or fonts.
- **lib**: Contains the Dart source code for the Haba application.
- **models**: Contains data models used in the application.
- **providers**: Contains provider classes responsible for managing the app's state.
- **screens**: Contains UI screens and widgets.
- **services**: Contains services and API calls used in the app.
- **main_dev.dart**: Entry point for the app with the `dev` flavor.
- **main_live.dart**: Entry point for the app with the `live` flavor.

### Running the App

Haba offers two flavors: `dev` and `live`. To run the app with the respective flavors, use the following commands:

- For the `dev` flavor:
`flutter run --flavor dev -t lib/main_dev.dart`


- For the `live` flavor:
`flutter run --flavor live -t lib/main_live.dart`


Make sure you have a compatible device or simulator connected to your development environment.

### Additional Configuration

Here are some additional things you might need to set up:

- **Backend Integration**: faraja relies on backend services for some functionalities. Make sure to configure the backend endpoints and necessary authentication tokens in the appropriate files (`lib/main_dev.dart` and `lib/main_live.dart`).

- **Third-Party Dependencies**: If faraja relies on any third-party services or libraries, follow the documentation provided by those services to set up the required credentials or configurations.

### Testing and Debugging

For testing and debugging, you can use the standard Flutter testing and debugging tools. Refer to the Flutter documentation for more details on running tests and debugging your Flutter applications.
